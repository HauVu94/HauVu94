### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hau!

I have recently completed my Bachelor's degree at Kristiania University College, studying Information Technology with a focus on programming. 
I am currently doing a summer internship at ECO STOR AS in Oslo, Norway, as a Junior Software Developer.

I am looking for a permanent job in the Oslo area. Please feel free to contact me for a conversation.
